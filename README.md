# Just another repo
This repo is just for fun and killing time, somebody got sudoku, I've got coding

```
We learn habits, automatic reactions, by repeatedly practicing behaviours.
We learn how to code by coding every day.
```

## Build
What you need is just a JDK installed on your machine, then just type
```
./gradlew
```
the gradle wrapper will take care of everything else and it will sequentially compile/test the java/scala files in the project

### Java and Scala 
As an exercise I've tried to simulate a project mixed in with Java and Scala to check how much gradle can cope with the crossover
I usually don't like to pack two languages in the same project, because it increases complexity at build level (imho it's easier with two separate projects ), but we're here just for the fun!
